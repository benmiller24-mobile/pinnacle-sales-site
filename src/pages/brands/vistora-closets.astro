<p>Most closet systems require complicated assembly of numerous parts and components. Vistora Closets are different. Built by W.W. Wood Products at their state-of-the-art facilities in Dudley, Missouri — where they've manufactured since 1977 across over 1.5 million square feet of production space — Vistora offers a wide range of fully assembled closet cabinets with configurations and accessories already built in. The result is a system that's simpler to design, faster to install, and delivers a more custom, furniture-quality finished look.</p>

<h2>The Vistora Difference: Pre-Assembled Modular Units</h2>
<p>Where a typical closet system might require assembling 20 to 30 individual parts in a single small closet, a comparable Vistora design may only need 4 or 5 pre-assembled components. Each floor-mounted module sits on the ground like fine furniture, creating a high-end custom appearance without the complexity of traditional flat-pack closet systems. Dealers can help customers with planning, design, and installation — simplifying the entire process from showroom to finished closet.</p>

<h2>Product Categories</h2>

<div class="product-line">
  <h3>Upright Cabinets</h3>
  <p>The backbone of every Vistora closet. Uprights are available with double hangers, single hangers, shoe shelves, adjustable shelves, drawers, baskets, and upper door combinations — all pre-assembled. Mix and match configurations to build the perfect closet without loose parts or complicated assembly directions.</p>
</div>

<div class="product-line">
  <h3>Base Cabinets</h3>
  <p>Floor-level storage units including 3-drawer and 4-drawer bases, door-mount hampers, shoe open shelves with door options, and mini open shelf units. Designed to complement uprights and maximize every inch of closet space.</p>
</div>

<div class="product-line">
  <h3>Accessories & Hardware</h3>
  <p>Complete the system with closet rods, pull-down closet rods, bridge shelf kits, adjustable shelves, jewelry drawer inserts, and finished panels. Hardware available in Matte Black (Series A) and Matte Chrome (Series B) to match any aesthetic.</p>
</div>

<h2>Nine Finish Options</h2>
<p>Vistora's curated finish palette offers versatile options to suit any home style — from light neutrals to rich wood tones. Each finish coordinates beautifully with existing bedroom and home decor.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Design Gallery</h2>
<p>Vistora's online gallery at <a href="https://vistoraclosets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vistoraclosets.com</a> features select closet designs with interactive feature buttons that reveal specific product information for each item in the design — helping dealers and homeowners plan their perfect closet with confidence.</p>

<h2>Why Add Closets to Your Dealership?</h2>
<p>Many kitchen customers also need walk-in closet systems, reach-in closet organization, pantry storage, and mudroom solutions. Vistora's pre-assembled modular approach means dealers don't need specialized closet installation expertise — the simplified component system is far easier to design and install than traditional closet brands. It's an opportunity to capture whole-home projects, increase average order value, and keep business that would otherwise go to a dedicated closet company.</p>
