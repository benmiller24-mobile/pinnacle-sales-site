<p>When it comes to custom cabinetry, few decisions make a more visible impact than the door style. At Pinnacle Sales, we're seeing designers and homeowners shift toward the modern inset look — and for good reason.</p>

<h2>Did You Know?</h2>

The style is a hybrid between traditional inset construction and frameless European construction. Shiloh's Inset cabinetry comes with one of the tallest top drawers in the industry, delivering a sleek, high-functioning look perfect for upscale kitchens and built-ins. This customization is included — no upcharge required.</p>
