<BlogPost title="Frameless vs Face-Frame Cabinets: Which Construction Method Is Right for Your Kitchen?" description="Understanding the differences between frameless and face-frame cabinet construction helps dealers guide clients to the right solution. Compare Shiloh, Eclipse, Aspect, and Pronorm." author="Ben Miller" publishedDate="2026-02-08">

<p>When kitchen dealers help homeowners choose cabinetry, one of the most fundamental decisions comes down to construction method: frameless or face-frame. This choice affects everything from aesthetics and storage capacity to installation complexity and price point. Understanding the differences between these two approaches is essential for any dealer looking to guide their clients toward the right solution.</p>

<p>At Pinnacle Sales, we represent brands that excel in both construction methods. <a href="/brands/shiloh-cabinetry">Shiloh Cabinetry</a> and <a href="/brands/eclipse-cabinetry">Eclipse Cabinetry</a> by Shiloh offer outstanding face-frame and frameless options respectively, while <a href="/brands/aspect-cabinetry">Aspect Cabinetry</a> provides value-driven solutions and <a href="/brands/pronorm-german-kitchens">Pronorm German Kitchens</a> delivers the pinnacle of European frameless engineering. This gives our dealers across Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Washington the flexibility to match any design vision and budget.</p>

<h2>Understanding Face-Frame Construction</h2>

<p>Face-frame cabinets represent the traditional American approach to cabinetry. A solid wood frame, typically made from hardwood like maple or oak, is attached to the front of the cabinet box. This frame usually features stiles (vertical members) that are 1.5 inches wide and rails (horizontal members) of similar dimension. The frame provides structural rigidity, serves as a mounting surface for hinges and door hardware, and creates the classic look that has defined American kitchens for generations. Shiloh Cabinetry has built its reputation on exceptional face-frame construction, offering an enormous range of door styles, finishes, and wood species that allow dealers to create truly custom solutions for their clients.</p>

<p>The advantages of face-frame construction are significant. The frame adds structural strength, making the cabinet box more resistant to racking and warping over time. It also allows for more forgiving installation since the frame can cover minor gaps between cabinets or between cabinets and walls. For dealers, this means faster installation times and fewer callbacks. Face-frame cabinets also accommodate both concealed European-style hinges and traditional exposed hinges, giving designers maximum flexibility in achieving different aesthetic goals.</p>

<p>However, face-frame construction does have trade-offs. The frame reduces the usable interior width of each cabinet by approximately three inches, which means slightly less accessible storage space. Drawers must be sized to fit within the frame opening, and the stiles between adjacent doors create visible lines that some homeowners find less streamlined than the seamless look of frameless cabinetry.</p>

<h2>Understanding Frameless Construction</h2>

<p>Frameless cabinetry, also known as full-access or European-style cabinetry, eliminates the face frame entirely. The cabinet box is constructed from thicker side panels, typically 3/4-inch material, and the doors and drawers overlay the entire front of the box with minimal gaps between them. This construction method originated in post-war Europe where material efficiency and modern aesthetics drove innovation in furniture and cabinet making. Today, frameless construction is the global standard and represents the fastest-growing segment of the North American kitchen market.</p>

<p><a href="/brands/eclipse-cabinetry">Eclipse Cabinetry</a> by Shiloh is a standout example of modern frameless construction done right. Eclipse combines the precision engineering of full-access design with the quality craftsmanship and customization options that Shiloh is known for. For dealers, Eclipse offers an accessible entry point into frameless cabinetry with reliable lead times, competitive pricing, and the backing of a trusted American manufacturer. <a href="/brands/pronorm-german-kitchens">Pronorm German Kitchens</a> takes frameless construction to its highest expression, with German-engineered precision, innovative hardware systems, and finish options that represent the absolute cutting edge of kitchen design.</p>

<p>The primary advantage of frameless construction is maximized interior space. Without the face frame reducing the opening, drawers and pull-out accessories can be wider, providing up to 15 percent more usable storage in the same cabinet footprint. The full-overlay doors create a sleek, seamless appearance with minimal reveal lines between doors, which aligns perfectly with the clean-lined contemporary and transitional designs that dominate today's market.</p>

<p>Frameless construction does require more precision during installation since there is no frame to mask minor gaps or alignment issues. However, modern frameless systems from brands like Eclipse and Pronorm include integrated leveling hardware and standardized boring patterns that actually simplify installation once the installer is familiar with the system.</p>

<h2>How to Help Your Clients Choose</h2>

<p>The best dealers understand that the frameless versus face-frame decision should be driven by the client's design preferences, lifestyle needs, and budget rather than by the dealer's comfort level with one construction method over another. Design style is often the strongest indicator. Homeowners drawn to traditional, farmhouse, or classic American aesthetics will typically prefer the warmth and character of face-frame cabinetry. Those gravitating toward contemporary, modern, transitional, or European design will usually favor the clean lines of frameless construction.</p>

<p>Storage priorities matter too. Families who need maximum storage efficiency and love pull-out organizers, deep drawers, and integrated accessories will benefit from the wider openings that frameless cabinets provide. Many successful dealers offer both construction methods, positioning face-frame lines like Shiloh and Aspect alongside frameless options from Eclipse and Pronorm. This allows them to serve a broader client base and capture projects at every price point.</p>
