<BlogPost title="How Showcasing Installed Projects Helps Dealers Stand Out" description="See how Caruso Kitchen Designs created a compelling video showcase with Eclipse Cabinetry and learn how to get your projects featured." author="Ceadrick Kivare" publishedDate="2026-01-15">

<p>In a world where great design meets even greater competition, showing is more powerful than telling. Pinnacle Sales recently partnered with Caruso Kitchen Designs to highlight a beautiful, modern kitchen featuring <a href="/brands/eclipse-cabinetry">Eclipse Cabinetry by Shiloh</a>.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters for Your Business</h2>
<ul>
<li>Eclipse Cabinetry's frameless full-access platform delivers a sleek, European-inspired design that builders and designers love</li>
<li>Smart features like tiered combination drawers and custom square panel bar backs make these kitchens as functional as they are stunning</li>
<li>Real-world installs give future clients and partners visual proof of what you're capable of</li>
</ul>

<h2>Showcasing = Trust Building</h2>
<p>When clients see what you've done — not just what you sell — it builds credibility, differentiates your business, and elevates your brand.</p>

<h2>Want to Be Featured?</h2>
<p>We're actively inviting dealers and designers with completed Eclipse installations to collaborate on video or photo showcases. We'll help capture your work and share it through our channels, giving you marketing content you can use again and again. Reach out to your Pinnacle Sales rep or email <a href="mailto:marketing@pinnaclesales.biz">marketing@pinnaclesales.biz</a> to get started.</p>
