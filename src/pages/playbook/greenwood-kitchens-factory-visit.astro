<p>At Pinnacle Sales, we believe that strong relationships are the foundation of long-term success in our industry. We had the pleasure of supporting a meaningful and productive visit between our valued partners at Greenwood Kitchens and the team at WW Wood Products.</p>

<p>We extend a warm thank-you to Wendy, Gavi, and Betsy from Greenwood Kitchens for making the trip to tour the WW Wood facility alongside Anna Fisher. Their engagement and enthusiasm made the visit both insightful and enjoyable.</p>

<p>During the tour, the group explored WW Wood's impressive manufacturing operations, gained firsthand insight into their craftsmanship, and deepened the collaborative ties between our organizations. From detailed factory walk-throughs to thoughtful conversations about current and future opportunities, the visit reinforced the shared commitment to quality and service excellence.</p>
