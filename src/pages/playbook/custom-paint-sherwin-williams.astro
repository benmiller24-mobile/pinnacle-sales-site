<BlogPost title="Why Dealers Are Turning to Custom Paint with Sherwin-Williams Colors" description="Eclipse and Shiloh's Custom Paint Program lets dealers spec any Standard Sherwin-Williams color on cabinetry. Here's how it works." author="Ben Miller" publishedDate="2025-07-18">

<p>Looking to win over homeowners with a bold or custom finish? WW Wood Products' <a href="/brands/eclipse-cabinetry">Eclipse</a> and <a href="/brands/shiloh-cabinetry">Shiloh</a> cabinet lines offer a Custom Paint Program — unlocking limitless design potential by allowing dealers to spec any "Standard" paint color from Sherwin-Williams.</p>

<blockquote>"We've seen increasing demand from designers who want to match cabinet finishes with other elements in the home — this program gives them the tools."</blockquote>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pick a Sherwin-Williams "Standard" color (e.g., SW6671)</li>
<li>Submit a sample door order + pre-approval from customer service</li>
<li>Minimum order: $15,000 list price</li>
<li>Custom color program adds a 20% upcharge</li>
<li>Smaller jobs: flat $750 custom paint fee applies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why It Matters for Your Showroom</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design Flexibility</strong> = fewer lost jobs to local shops offering full custom</li>
<li><strong>Familiar Color System</strong> = confidence for both designers and end-users</li>
<li><strong>Streamlined Process</strong> = samples approved before build</li>
</ul>
