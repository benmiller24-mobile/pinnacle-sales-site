<BlogPost title="Dealer Spotlight: Plum Kitchens, Denver" description="Plum Kitchens paired Shiloh's Beaded Inset cabinetry with walnut and painted finishes in a Denver home that balances period charm and function." author="Ben Miller" publishedDate="2025-06-01">

<p>When Kaimee Martelli and the Plum Kitchens team shared these beautiful images, we knew they belonged in the Kitchen Dealer Playbook. The remodel pairs <a href="/brands/shiloh-cabinetry">Shiloh's Beaded Inset</a> cabinetry in a Denver home — and nails the balance between period charm and fresh functionality.</p>

<h2>3 Stand-Out Details Dealers Should Steal</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom dog-bowl compartment:</strong> Integrates pet-friendly living without clutter</li>
<li><strong>Beaded Inset refrigerator panels:</strong> Seamless fridge facade shows off Shiloh's catalog-standard precision</li>
<li><strong>Mixed-material palette:</strong> Walnut lowers and painted uppers hit the hottest designer trend while respecting historic bones</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Power of Beaded Inset</h2>
<p>Shiloh's beaded inset joinery is built by routing a delicate bead around each opening. Doors sit flush yet read like furniture — no extra fee, no extended lead time. Unlike many competitors, beaded inset is priced the same as overlay.</p>

<h2>Quick Spec Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Door Group:</strong> Beaded Inset / Square edge / Lancaster</li>
<li><strong>Species & Finish:</strong> Walnut Natural (bases), Maple Polar (uppers)</li>
<li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Satin Brass pulls & faucets</li>
<li><strong>Extras:</strong> Full-height fridge panels, custom dog feeding bay, furniture toe kicks on island</li>
</ul>

<p>Contractor: Norton Custom Construction. Location: Denver, Colorado.</p>
