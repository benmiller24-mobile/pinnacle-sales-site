  {q:"How do I become a dealer?", a:"Visit our Become a Dealer page to apply. We'll review your application, discuss territory availability, and set up an introductory call to explore which brands are the right fit for your showroom."},
  {q:"What support does Pinnacle Sales provide to dealers?", a:"We offer hands-on sales training, showroom merchandising support, 2020/Winner design services, technical assistance, marketing resources, factory tours, and ongoing business development consultation."},
  {q:"What are typical lead times for cabinetry orders?", a:"Shiloh, Eclipse, and Aspect cabinetry typically ships in approximately 6 weeks. Nevara ships in 5-6 weeks. Pronorm German Kitchens have a 10-14 week production lead time plus international shipping."},
  {q:"What is the difference between Shiloh and Eclipse?", a:"Shiloh is face-frame and inset box construction, while Eclipse is frameless (full-access) construction inspired by European design. Both are built by WW Wood Products in Missouri with similar quality standards."},
  {q:"Does Pinnacle Sales work with builders?", a:"Yes. Many of our dealers serve builder clients. Aspect Cabinetry is frequently chosen for builder projects, with Shiloh and Eclipse available for custom and semi-custom upgrades."},
  {q:"What is Pronorm and how is it different from American brands?", a:"Pronorm is a premium German fitted kitchen manufacturer. Unlike American cabinetry sold as individual boxes, German kitchens are engineered as complete systems with every element designed to work together with precision tolerances measured in fractions of a millimeter."},
  {q:"Can I order custom paint colors on Shiloh or Eclipse?", a:"Yes. Both Shiloh and Eclipse offer a Custom Paint Program allowing you to spec any Standard Sherwin-Williams color. A sample door must be approved first. Minimum order is $15,000 list with a 20% custom color upcharge, or a flat $750 fee for smaller jobs."},
  {q:"What is the difference between frameless and face-frame cabinets?", a:"Face-frame cabinets have a solid wood frame attached to the front of the box, providing traditional American aesthetics and forgiving installation. Frameless (full-access) cabinets eliminate the face frame for a sleek, modern look and up to 15% more usable interior space. We carry brands in both styles."},
  {q:"Does Pinnacle Sales offer design and quoting services?", a:"Yes. Our team provides 2020/Winner design and quoting support for complex projects, multi-brand specifications, and custom configurations. We work alongside your design team to move projects from concept to order."},
  {q:"How do showroom display programs work?", a:"Our manufacturers offer display programs that can subsidize sample and vignette costs for qualifying dealers. Programs vary by brand and typically involve minimum annual purchase commitments. Contact your Pinnacle Sales rep for current display program details."},
  {q:"Can I carry Pronorm without being a WW Wood Products dealer?", a:"Yes. Pronorm German Kitchens are distributed independently through European Kitchen Distributors (EKD), a Pinnacle Sales company. Pronorm is available nationwide with protected dealer territories, regardless of whether you carry WW Wood brands."}
