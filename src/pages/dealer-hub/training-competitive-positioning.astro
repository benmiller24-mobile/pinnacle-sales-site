<h1>Competitive Positioning</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">How to position Shiloh, Eclipse, and the full Pinnacle portfolio against the competition at every price point.</p>

<h2>The Pinnacle Portfolio Strategy</h2>
<p>Pinnacle Sales dealers have a unique advantage: a portfolio that covers every price tier and construction type from a single rep group. This means you can capture the customer regardless of their budget — without sending them to a competitor. The key is knowing when to reach for which brand.</p>

<h2>Shiloh vs. Key Competitors</h2>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Shiloh vs. Kraftmaid</h3>
  <p>Kraftmaid is the most common competitor your customers will reference. Key advantages for Shiloh:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Full ¾″ plywood box</strong> — Kraftmaid uses particleboard in many configurations</li>
    <li><strong>6 inset options</strong> — Kraftmaid has limited inset availability</li>
    <li><strong>Custom paint matching</strong> — Any Sherwin-Williams color; Kraftmaid restricts to their palette</li>
    <li><strong>Dealer-direct pricing</strong> — No big-box markup chain; more margin for the dealer</li>
    <li><strong>Lead times</strong> — Competitive or faster depending on configuration</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Shiloh vs. Showplace</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Similar price tier and quality positioning</li>
    <li>Shiloh's advantage: deeper inset program and broader finish options</li>
    <li>Both offer strong dealer support — differentiate on local rep relationship (you have Pinnacle)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Shiloh vs. Medallion / Yorktowne</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Shiloh typically prices more competitively with comparable or better construction</li>
    <li>Emphasize the ¾″ plywood standard, soft-close standard, and the breadth of finish options</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Eclipse vs. Key Competitors</h2>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Eclipse vs. Crystal / Bellmont / Fabuwood</h3>
  <p>Eclipse competes in the domestic frameless space where options are surprisingly limited at this quality level:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vertical grain matching at no charge</strong> — Most competitors upcharge significantly or don't offer it</li>
    <li><strong>Matching tops/bottoms on wall cabinets standard</strong> — A detail competitors often skip</li>
    <li><strong>Same finish program as Shiloh</strong> — Competitors often have narrower frameless finish selections</li>
    <li><strong>Built on the same production lines as Shiloh</strong> — Same quality standards, same manufacturer</li>
    <li><strong>Price positioning</strong> — Eclipse delivers premium frameless quality without the premium European price tag</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Eclipse vs. European Imports</h3>
  <p>When customers want "the European look" but may not have the budget for a full German kitchen:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Eclipse delivers the clean frameless aesthetic at a fraction of the cost of imported European lines</li>
    <li>No currency exchange risk, no overseas shipping delays, no container minimums</li>
    <li>Domestic warranty and service — issues resolved in days, not weeks</li>
    <li>If the customer does want to step up to imported German: you have Pronorm in your portfolio</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Pronorm vs. Other German Brands</h2>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Pronorm's Sweet Spot</h3>
  <p>Pronorm fills a specific gap in the market between entry-level German brands (Nobilia, Häcker) and ultra-premium (SieMatic, Poggenpohl, Bulthaup):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>610mm (24″) cabinet depths</strong> — Most German brands ship at 560-580mm, requiring workarounds for American kitchens</li>
    <li><strong>Three combinable product lines</strong> — Mix handleless and handled in the same kitchen</li>
    <li><strong>100+ door finishes</strong> including organic glass (anti-fingerprint, scratch-resistant)</li>
    <li><strong>$40K–$150K+ installations</strong> — accessible luxury, not ultra-niche</li>
    <li><strong>Exclusive US distribution through Pinnacle</strong> — no cross-shopping at the dealer down the street</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Handling Common Objections</h2>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>"I can get cabinets cheaper at [big-box store]"</h3>
  <p>Acknowledge the price difference, then redirect to value: ¾″ plywood vs. particleboard, soft-close standard vs. upgrade, custom sizing vs. stock sizes, professional design support vs. self-serve, and a 10-year warranty backed by a manufacturer that's been building since 1977. The price gap narrows significantly when you compare apples to apples.</p>
</div>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>"Why haven't I heard of Shiloh / Eclipse?"</h3>
  <p>Shiloh and Eclipse are professional dealer brands — they don't sell through big-box retailers or direct to consumer. That's actually an advantage for your customer: they get dealer-level pricing, design expertise, and personalized service that mass-market brands can't provide. WW Wood Products is one of the largest cabinet manufacturers in the country with over 1.5 million square feet of production space.</p>
</div>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>"I want European but it's too expensive"</h3>
  <p>This is your Eclipse moment. Eclipse delivers the frameless European aesthetic with domestic pricing, lead times, and warranty. If they truly want imported German, Pronorm is in your portfolio too — and at a more accessible price point than SieMatic or Poggenpohl.</p>
