<h1>Product Deep-Dive</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">Construction methods, finish options, pricing structure, lead times, and key differentiators for every brand in the Pinnacle Sales portfolio.</p>

<h2>Shiloh Cabinetry</h2>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Construction</h3>
  <p>Shiloh is a framed (face-frame) cabinet line built on ¾″ plywood construction. The face frame provides additional structural rigidity and a traditional aesthetic that resonates with the majority of American homeowners. Shiloh offers both standard overlay and six distinct inset door configurations — more inset options than virtually any competitor at this price point.</p>
</div>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Finish Program</h3>
  <p>Shiloh offers an exceptionally deep finish program including stains, paints, glazes, distressing, and specialty techniques across multiple wood species: Maple, Cherry, Hickory, Quartersawn White Oak, Rustic Alder, and more. The custom paint program matches any Sherwin-Williams color — a major differentiator when designers need a specific color for their project.</p>
</div>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Key Selling Points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Broadest inset offering at this price tier (6 inset configurations)</li>
    <li>Custom paint matching to any Sherwin-Williams color</li>
    <li>Full ¾″ plywood box construction standard</li>
    <li>Soft-close hinges and drawer slides standard on all cabinets</li>
    <li>10-year warranty</li>
    <li>Lead times typically 4-6 weeks depending on configuration</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Eclipse Cabinetry</h2>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Construction</h3>
  <p>Eclipse is a full-access frameless cabinet line with ¾″ plywood box construction. Frameless construction means no face frame — the door covers the entire cabinet front, creating the clean, modern European aesthetic increasingly demanded by today's homeowners and designers. Eclipse is built on the same production lines as Shiloh, delivering premium frameless quality at an accessible price point.</p>
</div>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Standout Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Vertical grain matching included at no charge on all wood veneers and wood grain laminates</li>
    <li>Tops and bottoms of wall cabinets automatically match the door finish at no upcharge with standard box construction</li>
    <li>Full-access interior — wider drawers and more usable storage than face-frame equivalents</li>
    <li>Same finish program as Shiloh, including custom Sherwin-Williams paint matching</li>
    <li>10-year warranty</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Framed vs. Frameless — How to Present It</h3>
  <p>Many customers don't understand the difference. The simplest explanation: framed cabinets (Shiloh) have a wood border around the cabinet opening, giving a traditional look with visible frame between doors. Frameless cabinets (Eclipse) have doors that cover nearly the full cabinet face, creating a sleek, contemporary appearance with minimal gaps. Both use the same ¾″ plywood — the choice is aesthetic, not quality.</p>
</div>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>GOLA Channel Collection</h3>
  <p>Eclipse offers a built-in GOLA channel handle system — an integrated aluminum channel routed directly into the cabinet door or drawer front, eliminating the need for external hardware. The result is a seamless, ultra-modern aesthetic that's become a signature of high-end European kitchen design. GOLA channels are available in multiple profiles and finishes to match any contemporary project.</p>

<h2>Vistora Closets</h2>

<div class="module-section">
  <h3>Overview</h3>

Where typical closet systems require 20-30 individual parts per closet, Vistora uses 4-5 pre-assembled floor-mounted modules with accessories already built in. Nine finish options. Hardware in Matte Black and Matte Chrome. Ideal add-on for kitchen dealers who want to capture whole-home projects.</p>
