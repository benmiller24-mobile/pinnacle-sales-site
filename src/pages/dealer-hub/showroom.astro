<h1>Showroom Standards</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">Display requirements, sample programs, and visual guidelines to help your showroom sell effectively.</p>

<h2>Display Philosophy</h2>
<p>Your showroom is where clients make their decision. The goal is not to show everything — it's to show the right things in a way that tells a story. Every display should answer the client's question: "What would this look like in my home?"</p>

<p>Pinnacle Sales works with each dealer to create a showroom plan that balances brand representation, market positioning, and available space. We'll help you prioritize which products to display, where to place them, and how to merchandise samples for maximum impact.</p>

<h2>Shiloh & Eclipse Displays</h2>

<h3>Eclipse Merchandiser</h3>
<p>The <a href="/playbook/eclipse-merchandiser-display">Eclipse Merchandiser</a> is a compact, showroom-ready display unit designed to showcase Eclipse's full finish library in a small footprint. It holds door samples, finish chips, and hardware options in an organized, client-friendly format.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Recommended for all Eclipse dealers</li>
  <li>Compact footprint — fits in most showroom configurations</li>
  <li>Organized by finish category for easy client navigation</li>
  <li>Contact Pinnacle Sales to order</li>
</ul>

<h3>Door Sample Racks</h3>
<p>Shiloh and Eclipse door samples should be displayed in organized racks or wall-mounted systems. Recommended approach:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Group by construction type (face-frame, frameless, inset)</li>
  <li>Show the most popular finishes prominently — Painted White, Painted Gray, White Oak, Walnut</li>
  <li>Include at least one inset door sample (Shiloh's biggest differentiator)</li>
  <li>Rotate seasonal or trending finishes quarterly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vignette Displays</h3>
<p>If space allows, a full or partial kitchen vignette is the most effective selling tool. Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feature one primary brand per vignette (Shiloh, Eclipse, or Pronorm)</li>
  <li>Include countertop, hardware, and lighting to create a complete picture</li>
  <li>Use contrasting elements — island in a different finish or material to show range</li>
  <li>Include functional drawers and doors so clients can feel the quality</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pronorm Display Standards</h2>
<p>Pronorm displays should reflect the brand's premium German positioning. Pinnacle Sales / EKD works directly with each Pronorm dealer to plan and install showroom displays.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Minimum display: one full kitchen vignette with island or peninsula</li>
  <li>Must include at least two Pronorm product lines (e.g., Y-Line handleless + Modern Shaker LF)</li>
  <li>Integrated appliances recommended (Pronorm designs around specific appliance models)</li>
  <li>Lighting design is critical — under-cabinet, in-drawer, and ambient lighting should be demonstrated</li>
  <li>Display materials and specifications provided by Pronorm through EKD</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Management</h2>
<p>Keep your sample library current and organized:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Quarterly audit:</strong> Remove discontinued finishes and door styles. Pinnacle Sales sends discontinuation notices in advance.</li>
  <li><strong>New product additions:</strong> When new finishes or door styles launch, request updated samples from your Pinnacle Sales rep within 30 days.</li>
  <li><strong>Lending program:</strong> Large door samples and finish boards can be loaned to clients for in-home review. Track loans and set return expectations (7-10 days typical).</li>
  <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Replace samples that show wear, fading, or damage. These represent your brand to clients.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Signage & Brand Presentation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Display official brand logos near each product display area</li>
  <li>Use provided brand signage — do not create custom brand graphics without approval</li>
  <li>Price sheets and brochures should be accessible but not cluttered</li>
  <li>Digital displays showing lifestyle photography and project galleries are highly effective</li>
</ul>

<h2>Showroom Planning Support</h2>
<p>Pinnacle Sales offers complimentary showroom planning consultations. We'll visit your space (or review photos and floor plans remotely) and provide recommendations for display layout, brand positioning, sample organization, and traffic flow.</p>

<p>Schedule a showroom consultation by contacting your territory rep or emailing <a href="mailto:marketing@pinnaclesales.biz">marketing@pinnaclesales.biz</a>.</p>
