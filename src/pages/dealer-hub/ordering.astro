<h1>Ordering Standard Operating Procedures</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">Step-by-step process from project quote to delivery for every Pinnacle Sales brand.</p>

<h2>Shiloh / Eclipse / Aspect — WW Wood Products</h2>

<ol class="step-list">
  <li><strong>Design & Specification</strong> — Create the project in 20/20 Design or ProKitchen using the appropriate Shiloh, Eclipse, or Aspect catalog. Verify door style, finish, wood species, modifications, and accessories. Export a preliminary quote for client review.</li>
  <li><strong>Pre-Order Review (First 3-4 Projects)</strong> — For your first 3-4 projects, email the 20/20 / ProKitchen project file to your Pinnacle Sales rep for a full review before ordering. We check for spec errors, pricing optimization, modification feasibility, and lead-time items that could delay delivery. After that, you're cleared to order on your own — with design reviews by Pinnacle Sales available anytime you need a second set of eyes.</li>
  <li><strong>Submit Order to WW Wood</strong> — Once the client approves, submit the order through the WW Wood online ordering portal. Include PO number, ship-to address, and any special instructions. Custom paint orders require a Sherwin-Williams color code.</li>
  <li><strong>Order Acknowledgment (1 Business Day to Review)</strong> — WW Wood sends an order acknowledgment confirming specs, pricing, and estimated ship date. You have 1 business day to review and flag any changes or error corrections. Mark corrections directly on the acknowledgment and resend to <a href="mailto:orders@wwinc.com">orders@wwinc.com</a>. Do not consider the order final until you receive a revised acknowledgment reflecting your changes. Changes after this window may incur charges or reset lead time.</li>
  <li><strong>Production & Tracking</strong> — Standard lead time is approximately 6 weeks from order acknowledgment for Shiloh, Eclipse, Aspect, and Nevara. Track your order status through the WW Wood portal, check your delivery acknowledgment, or email <a href="mailto:customer.service@wwinc.com">customer.service@wwinc.com</a> with your order number for a delivery ETA.</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery Inspection</strong> — Inspect all cabinets upon delivery. Note any damage on the carrier's bill of lading before signing. Report damage or missing items to WW Wood customer service within 5 business days. Contact Pinnacle Sales if you need help with a claim.</li>
