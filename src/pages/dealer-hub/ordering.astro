<h1>Ordering Standard Operating Procedures</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">Step-by-step process from project quote to delivery for every Pinnacle Sales brand.</p>

<h2>Shiloh / Eclipse / Aspect — WW Wood Products</h2>

<ol class="step-list">
  <li><strong>Design & Specification</strong> — Create the project in 20/20 Design or ProKitchen using the appropriate Shiloh, Eclipse, or Aspect catalog. Verify door style, finish, wood species, modifications, and accessories. Export a preliminary quote for client review.</li>
  <li><strong>Pre-Order Review (First 3-4 Projects)</strong> — For your first 3-4 projects, email the 20/20 / ProKitchen project file to your Pinnacle Sales rep for a full review before ordering. We check for spec errors, pricing optimization, modification feasibility, and lead-time items that could delay delivery. After that, you're cleared to order on your own — with design reviews by Pinnacle Sales available anytime you need a second set of eyes.</li>
  <li><strong>Submit Order to WW Wood</strong> — Once the client approves, submit the order through the WW Wood online ordering portal. Include PO number, ship-to address, and any special instructions. Custom paint orders require a Sherwin-Williams color code.</li>
  <li><strong>Order Acknowledgment</strong> — WW Wood sends an order acknowledgment within 1-2 business days confirming specs, pricing, and estimated ship date. Review carefully — changes after acknowledgment may incur charges or delay.</li>
  <li><strong>Production & Tracking</strong> — Standard lead time is approximately 6 weeks from order acknowledgment. Nevara ships in 5-6 weeks. Track order status through the WW Wood portal or contact your Pinnacle Sales rep.</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery Inspection</strong> — Inspect all cabinets upon delivery. Note any damage on the carrier's bill of lading before signing. Report damage or missing items to WW Wood customer service within 5 business days. Contact Pinnacle Sales if you need help with a claim.</li>
</ol>

  <li><strong>Order Submission</strong> — Place the order through Pinnacle Sales. Lead times vary by configuration complexity — typically 4-6 weeks.</li>
