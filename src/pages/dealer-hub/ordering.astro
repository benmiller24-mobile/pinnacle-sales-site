<h1>Ordering Standard Operating Procedures</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">Step-by-step process from project quote to delivery for every Pinnacle Sales brand.</p>

<h2>Shiloh / Eclipse / Aspect — WW Wood Products</h2>

<ol class="step-list">
  <li><strong>Design & Specification</strong> — Create the project in 2020 Design or Winner using the appropriate Shiloh, Eclipse, or Aspect catalog. Verify door style, finish, wood species, modifications, and accessories. Export a preliminary quote for client review.</li>
  <li><strong>Pre-Order Review (Recommended)</strong> — Email the 2020/Winner project file to your Pinnacle Sales rep for review before ordering. We check for spec errors, pricing optimization, modification feasibility, and lead-time items that could delay delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>Submit Order to WW Wood</strong> — Once the client approves, submit the order through the WW Wood online ordering portal. Include PO number, ship-to address, and any special instructions. Custom paint orders require a Sherwin-Williams color code.</li>
  <li><strong>Order Acknowledgment</strong> — WW Wood sends an order acknowledgment within 1-2 business days confirming specs, pricing, and estimated ship date. Review carefully — changes after acknowledgment may incur charges or delay.</li>
  <li><strong>Production & Tracking</strong> — Standard lead time is approximately 6 weeks from order acknowledgment. Nevara ships in 5-6 weeks. Track order status through the WW Wood portal or contact your Pinnacle Sales rep.</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery Inspection</strong> — Inspect all cabinets upon delivery. Note any damage on the carrier's bill of lading before signing. Report damage or missing items to WW Wood customer service within 5 business days. Contact Pinnacle Sales if you need help with a claim.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pronorm German Kitchens</h2>

<ol class="step-list">
  <li><strong>Design Consultation</strong> — Work with Pinnacle Sales / EKD to develop the kitchen design using Pronorm's proprietary planning software. We handle the full design specification process from concept through final technical drawings.</li>
  <li><strong>Client Presentation & Approval</strong> — Present the Pronorm design with 3D renderings, material selections, and pricing. Pinnacle Sales provides presentation support and can join client meetings in-person or virtually.</li>
