<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 15, 2026</p>

<p>Pinnacle Sales ("we," "us," or "our") operates the website pinnaclesales.biz. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you visit our website or interact with us.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Information you provide directly.</strong> When you submit a form on our website — such as the dealer application, contact form, or newsletter signup — we collect the information you enter, which may include your name, email address, phone number, company name, city, state, website URL, and message content.</p>

<p><strong>Information collected automatically.</strong> When you visit our website, our hosting provider (Netlify) and analytics tools may automatically collect certain technical information including your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URL, pages visited, and the date and time of your visit. This information is collected through server logs and, where applicable, cookies or similar technologies.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes: to respond to your inquiries and form submissions, to evaluate dealer partnership applications, to send you information about our brands and services that you have requested, to improve our website content and user experience, and to analyze aggregate website traffic and usage patterns.</p>

<p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>

<h2>Cookies and Analytics</h2>

<p>Our website may use cookies — small text files stored on your device — and third-party analytics services such as Google Analytics to understand how visitors use our site. These tools collect anonymous, aggregate data about page views, traffic sources, and user behavior. You can control cookie settings through your browser preferences. Most browsers allow you to refuse cookies or alert you when a cookie is being set.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>Our website is hosted on Netlify. Form submissions are processed through Netlify Forms. These services have their own privacy policies governing how they handle data. We may also use third-party services for analytics, email communication, or embedded content (such as LinkedIn or YouTube). Each of these services operates under its own privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>We retain form submission data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, typically for the duration of an active business relationship or inquiry. You may request deletion of your personal data at any time by contacting us.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information you provide from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Our website uses HTTPS encryption for all data transmitted between your browser and our servers. However, no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>

<p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including the right to access the personal data we hold about you, request correction of inaccurate data, request deletion of your data, and opt out of any marketing communications. California residents may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the information below.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>Our website is not directed to individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child under 16, we will take steps to delete it promptly.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this page periodically for the latest information.</p>
