<Breadcrumbs items={[{name:'Home',href:'/'},{name:'About'}]} />

<p>Pinnacle Sales is the leading manufacturers' representative firm serving independent kitchen and bath dealers across the Western United States. For over two decades, we have built our reputation on one core belief: when dealers succeed, everyone wins — manufacturers, homeowners, and the industry as a whole.</p>

<p>We represent five premium cabinetry brands — <a href="/brands/shiloh-cabinetry">Shiloh Cabinetry</a>, <a href="/brands/eclipse-cabinetry">Eclipse Cabinetry</a>, <a href="/brands/aspect-cabinetry">Aspect Cabinetry</a>, <a href="/brands/pronorm-german-kitchens">Pronorm German Kitchens</a>, and <a href="/brands/vistora-closets">Vistora Closets</a> — giving our dealer partners access to the full spectrum of kitchen and bath solutions, from value-driven semi-custom to ultra-premium European design.</p>

<h2>Our Mission: Connect | Collaborate | Create</h2>

<p><strong>Connect</strong> dealers with the right brands for their market and clientele. <strong>Collaborate</strong> with showroom teams through hands-on training, design services, and business development support. <strong>Create</strong> lasting partnerships built on trust, product knowledge, and a shared commitment to helping homeowners build beautiful spaces.</p>

<p>We exist to help independent kitchen dealers grow profitable businesses. That means more than just placing orders — it means working alongside your team to close projects, train staff on new product lines, plan showroom displays that sell, and develop marketing strategies that bring qualified traffic through your door.</p>
