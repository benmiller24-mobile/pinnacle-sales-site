<h2>Washington Kitchen Design Trends</h2>
<p>Washington's kitchen market is anchored by the Seattle-Bellevue metro — one of the highest-income, most design-aware markets in the country. Pacific Northwest homeowners gravitate toward modern and contemporary European aesthetics with a strong sustainability ethos. <a href="/brands/pronorm-german-kitchens">Pronorm German Kitchens</a> find enthusiastic reception in this market, where clients appreciate German engineering, low-VOC manufacturing, and the clean handleless Y-Line aesthetic.</p>
<p>The broader Puget Sound market supports strong demand for <a href="/brands/shiloh-cabinetry">Shiloh</a> and <a href="/brands/eclipse-cabinetry">Eclipse</a> across both remodeling and new construction. Spokane and Eastern Washington represent a growing mid-market with preference for transitional and modern farmhouse design. Washington's tech-industry clients are often early adopters of design trends, making the state a bellwether for what sells across the rest of our territory.</p>
