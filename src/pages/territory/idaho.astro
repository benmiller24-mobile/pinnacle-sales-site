<h2>Idaho Kitchen Design Trends</h2>
<p>Idaho's booming housing market has created strong demand for quality cabinetry across both new construction and remodeling. The Treasure Valley (Boise, Meridian, Nampa) is one of the fastest-growing metro areas in the Western US, attracting relocating homeowners from California and the Pacific Northwest who bring higher design expectations and budgets.</p>
<p>Transitional and modern farmhouse kitchens dominate in the Boise metro, with growing interest in frameless construction and clean European-influenced design. Sun Valley and Coeur d'Alene support a luxury second-home market where <a href="/brands/pronorm-german-kitchens">Pronorm German Kitchens</a> and <a href="/brands/shiloh-cabinetry">Shiloh's custom inset program</a> find strong demand.</p>
