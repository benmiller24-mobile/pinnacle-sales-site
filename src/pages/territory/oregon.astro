<h2>Oregon Kitchen Design Trends</h2>
<p>Oregon's design-forward market gravitates toward natural materials, sustainability, and clean-lined aesthetics. Portland leads with a strong preference for Japandi-influenced minimalism — light oak, slab fronts, concealed storage, and muted color palettes. Our <a href="/playbook/japan-inspired-kitchens">Japan-inspired kitchens article</a> outlines how to spec this look across multiple price points with our brand portfolio.</p>
<p>Bend's mountain-modern market and the Willamette Valley's wine country homes both drive demand for premium cabinetry with warm wood tones and transitional styling. Oregon designers respond well to <a href="/brands/pronorm-german-kitchens">Pronorm's</a> sustainable German manufacturing story and <a href="/brands/eclipse-cabinetry">Eclipse Cabinetry's</a> full-access frameless platform.</p>
