<h2>Nevada Kitchen Design Trends</h2>
<p>Nevada's kitchen market is driven by Las Vegas's dynamic residential construction and remodeling sector. The Vegas metro — including Henderson and Summerlin — favors bold contemporary design with high-gloss finishes, dramatic islands, and modern frameless cabinetry. <a href="/brands/eclipse-cabinetry">Eclipse Cabinetry</a> is a strong performer in this market with its sleek full-access construction and wide finish palette.</p>
<p>Northern Nevada's Reno-Sparks corridor and Lake Tahoe area support a different aesthetic — mountain-transitional with warm woods, painted combinations, and rustic accents. The state's active builder market, particularly in planned communities, creates volume opportunities for <a href="/brands/aspect-cabinetry">Aspect Cabinetry's</a> value-driven semi-custom platform.</p>
